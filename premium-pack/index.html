            <h2><span class="blue-text-span">Reading and watching stuff</span> won't make you a pro</h2>

            <p>It's easy to find SQL resources online to <strong>learn about SQL syntax</strong>. It's much more difficult to <strong>practice real-world SQL problem-solving</strong>.</p>

            <p>Most resources out there suck at taking you from beginner to expert. They <strong>focus on syntax over practice</strong>. You spend hours watching Youtube videos, Udemy courses, and reading bible-sized books. And you are still not an expert. You often get stuck when faced with real-world SQL queries. You constantly have to interrupt your work and google around. You're  dependent on cheat sheets or random tutorials. You don’t have the muscle memory of a real expert.</p> 

            <p>The reason is simple. <strong>It’s not possible to become a great dancer by mostly watching dance videos and reading dance books</strong>. You need experience. You need practice. You need <strong>smart and abundant practice</strong>. Only <strong>deliberate practice</strong> will make things stick and make you <strong>think in SQL</strong>.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="lp-item">
            <h2>Time to get <span class="yellow-text-span">get good</span> at SQL by really practicing?</h2>
            <p>If there was a way to learn each SQL concept succinctly, then practice it thoroughly with scores of perfectly paced exercises from easy to advanced, <strong>you’d get crazy good pretty fast</strong>.</p>

            <p>Mastery happens when you solve a lot of increasingly difficult SQL problems with more and more advanced SQL queries. For that, you have to practice with a lot of <strong>carefully designed real-world problems</strong>.</p>

            <p>This is the best way to internalize all the concepts and <strong>develop your SQL muscle memory</strong>. No more need for constant googling, cheat sheets and endless Youtube tutorials. You’ll write the most advanced SQL queries in a state of flow, without breaking a sweat.</p> 

            <p>With the right training program and dedicated effort, you can go from beginner to pro level in a week. That's where the <strong>SQL Boss</strong> program comes in.</p>

            <h2>Become a <span class="black-text-span">SQL Boss</span></h2>

            <p>My name is Ismaël. I’ve been a false beginner in SQL for many years. I followed countless tutorials, watched tons of Youtube videos, and read many books. No luck, I was still struggling when faced with real-world SQL problems to solve.
            </p> 

            <p>I found that if I wanted to master SQL, I’d have to <strong>practice it deliberately, with tons of carefully designed exercises, with real-world use cases</strong>. It turns out such training resources are scarce and I had to brute-force my way into SQL proficiency.</p>

            <p>That’s why I've created SQL Boss with a team a great teachers. It’s a SQL training program that focuses on learning by practicing like an athlete. Here’s how it works:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>180 real-world practice problems:</strong> get access to 180 exercises with video solutions, plus additional resources. You can go over them on your own time, at your own pace, and consolidate what you learned with the free lessons. Each lesson comes with carefully paced practice problems, from easy to hard. By working through these problems, you'll develop skills equivalent to years of experience. Each problem is provided with a complete solution. New lessons and exercises are added regularly and sent to your inbox.</li>
              <li><strong>Over-the-shoulder learning:</strong> you don't just get the SQL code of the complete solution. With the videos, you get to watch how we solve several practice problems step by step, and learn the reasoning behind the solution.</li>
              <li><strong>Portfolio project with curated datasets and teacher review:</strong> premium students also get access to a hand-curated database of 92 project-worthy real datasets and 2 detailed project assignments you can use to build your portfolio. At the end of the program, we'll review your completed project with precise feedback.</li>
              <li><strong>Google Analytics 4 ⇒ BigQuery SQL cookbook:</strong> a database of 50 pre-written SQL queries you can use to build regularly used Google Analytics reports, using the BigQuery raw data export. Examples: counting sessions across a dynamic date range, grouping users by acquisition campaign, listing most visited landing pages, calculating user retention by cohort etc. Use it as a big time saver, and as a starting point for your own customized queries.</li>
              <li><strong>Mentor and community support:</strong> private community where you can post comments, ask questions and get answers from the teachers and other premium students.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Could my employer pay for this?</strong>
            <p>Most employers are happy to pay for employee training that brings a return on investment. If you present it well, you might be able to get your employer to pay for you or reimburse you. Here's an example email you could send to your manager.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Hi {manager},</p><br><br>

              <p>I found this SQL training program called SQL Boss that could boost my SQL skills quickly. I'd like to enroll and put these new skills to good use here at {company_name}.</p>

              <p>Here are some key benefits:</p><br><br>

              <ul> 
                <li>52 lessons</li>
                <li>180 practice problems to improve my skills</li>
                <li>Step-by-step solutions in video</li>
                <li>Teacher-reviewed final project</li>
                <li>Private community with members and teacher support</li>
                <li>Regular content updates and additions</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The program costs $599 (USD) for an unlimited team license (one-time fee), or $249 (USD) for an individual license (one-time fee). If you like, you can review course details here, including the instructors' bios: https://sqlboss.co/</p><br><br>
              <p>What do you think?</p><br><br>
              <p>Thanks,<br>{Your Name}</p><br><br>

            <strong>Will I get an invoice?</strong>
            <p>Yes, we use Stripe for billing and send you an invoice automatically. If your company is paying for you and needs additional information on the invoice, such as company name and address, send us an email at sqlboss@userstand.com and we'll sort it out.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>How long do I have access to the program and its material?</strong>
            <p>You get lifetime access to all of the program's resources and material: video recordings, lessons, exercises with solutions, extra-resources etc.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What flavor of SQL will I learn?</strong>
            <p>We'll be using the Google Standard SQL dialect on the Google BigQuery database. It shouldn't matter much as the syntax variations that exist between database engines (Snowflake, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.) are small and easy to pick up.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>Does the program cover database design, modification or administration topics?</strong>
            <p>No. The program focuses on analysis and reporting, i.e answering business questions with SELECT-based queries. We cover user-defined functions, table functions, and views as they can be used to make better SELECT-based queries. We don't include anything that create, update or delete database records.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What equipment and software do I need?</strong>
            <p>Many teaching programs, courses and books ask you to install some desktop database software and toy datasets. We don't. There are too many horror stories of students unable to install the software and getting stuck. For the database, we use Google BigQuery. The live classes are taught over Google Meet. Both BigQuery and Meet have free plans and are browser-based. Bottom line: you only need a computer with an internet connection, and a Gmail account.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="chapter">
            <strong>What will be the outcome of the program?</strong>
            <p>After completing the program, you'll be comfortable reading and writing advanced SQL queries for any of the following roles: data analyst, BI analyst, marketing analyst, product analyst, business analyst, web analyst, etc.</p>
