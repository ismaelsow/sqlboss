    <p><strong>Result format</strong>: each practice problem is provided with an example screenshot of the expected results. Try to reproduce the columns, formatting and sorting order visible in the screenshot. Decimal numbers should generally be displayed with two decimals at most (as soon as you learn how to do it ðŸ˜Š). You could should follow this style guide as much as possible.</p>

    <p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There are usually many ways to solve a SQL problem. The code provided in each is just one way to do it.</li>
      <li>In general, try to use the features explained in the current lesson. For example, if the lesson introduces the LEAD function, you should try to solve the related practice problems using that function.</li>
      <li>In order to validate your solution, <strong>donâ€™t rely on the values displayed in the example screenshots: run the solution code in the BigQuery console and compare these real-time results with yours</strong>.</li>
      <li>Also note that if the thereâ€™s no <code>ORDER BY</code> clause use in the solution code, the rows you get might be different each time. In that case, do not worry as long the solution code also returns different values each time itâ€™s run.</li>
