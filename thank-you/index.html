<h2>The SQL Boss course</h2>

<div class="intro">
  <p><span style="font-weight:800">IsmaÃ«l here ðŸ‘‹</span></p>
  <p>I'm so happy you chose SQL Boss to upgrade your SQL skills. In a few minutes, you'll receive an email with everything you need to access the course. The bonus material is hosted on Notion, and I'll manually invite you to that Notion space under 24h.</p>
  <p>You'll also get your invoice from Stripe, the billing platform I'm using. And if you have any questions, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:sqlboss@userstand.com">sqlboss@userstand.com</a></p>
  <p>Happy SQL!</p>
