<p>On which days do humans celebrate their public holidays? I was wondering if nations tended to cluster along certain dates and time periods when it comes to public holidays. Below is a calendar heatmap of the public holidays of the UN member states in 2022.</p>

<div class="interactive-chart-wrapper">

</div>

<p>The 3 most celebrated public holidays, based on the gregorian calendar, are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New Year's Day (Jan 1st):</strong> celebrated in 156 countries.</li>
  <li><strong>Christmas (Dec 25th):</strong> celebrated in 121 countries.</li>
  <li><strong>Labor Day (May 1st):</strong> celebrated in 121 countries.</li>
</ul>
