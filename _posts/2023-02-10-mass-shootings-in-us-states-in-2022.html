title:  "Mass Shootings Victims in US States (2022)"
---

<p>As someone living outside the US, I've always been somewhat shocked by the neverending news of mass shootings. Also, in my imagination, it was something confined to the biggest states of the country. Diving into the data reveals that the biggest states (by population) are not necessarily the most affected by this problem.</p>

<p>Interesting thing to note: no mass shootings have been reported in Hawaii since 2013. It has been the only state free of mass shootings during this timeframe.</p>
