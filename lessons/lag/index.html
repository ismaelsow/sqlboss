<p><code>LAG</code> allows us to display values from previous rows. It takes up to 3 parameters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The column whose value we want to display.</li>
  <li>The offset (how are many rows back we want to go). By default, this is equal to 1.</li>
  <li>The default output to return if the offset is outside the bond of the window. By default, this is <code>NULL</code>.</li>
</ol>
