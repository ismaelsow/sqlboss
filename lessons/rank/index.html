<p><code>RANK</code> is similar to the <a href="/lessons/row-number/">ROW_NUMBER</a> function but its output is based on the value of the ranking column used in the <code>ORDER BY</code> inside the <code>OVER</code> clause. The rank may not be consecutive (for example, jumping from 1 to 5), taking into account rows with the same rank.</p>
