<p><code>LAST_VALUE</code> is used to display a column value from the last row in a window. It takes as parameter the column we want to display.</p>

<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">Example</span></h3>
<pre>
  <code class="language-sql">
SELECT    country,
          LAST_VALUE(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS last_user,
          LAST_VALUE(created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS last_user_signup_date
FROM      bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users
ORDER BY  country ASC;
  </code>
</pre>

<pre>
  <code class="language-sql">
SELECT    DISTINCT country,
          LAST_VALUE(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS last_user,
          LAST_VALUE(created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS last_user_signup_date
FROM      bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users
ORDER BY  country ASC;

  <h4>Task</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Write a query that will display the date and time of the first and last valid purchases in January 2021.</li>
    <li>You can make use of one of the user-defined functions created previously to generate a table of valid purchases.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Example results</h4>
