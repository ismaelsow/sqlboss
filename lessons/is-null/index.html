<p><code>NULL</code> is a special entity that means that there’s no value, not even an empty string. It means there's <strong>nothing</strong> in there.</p>
<p>Let's think about buildings (🏢) and elevators (🛗). We ask how many people are in a particular building's elevator. There could be five people (people_in_elevator = 5), ten people (people_in_elevator = 10), or even zero people. Zero means the elevator is empty but it's still a value (people_in_elevator = 0). Now, what if the building has no elevators? Since the building's elevator does not exist, there are not even zero people <strong>in it</strong>. In SQL, this nonexistence is represented
by <code>NULL</code> (people_in_elevator IS NULL).</p>
<p>We can not compare <code>NULL</code> using the regular operators. We need special syntax and functions to handle <code>NULL</code>. To check for <code>NULL</code> in a column, we use <code>IS NULL</code>.</p>
