<p><code>DENSE_RANK</code> is similar to <a href="/lessons/rank/">RANK</a>. Its output is based on the value of the ranking column used in the <code>ORDER BY</code> inside the <code>OVER</code> clause.</p>
<p>Here the rank is always consecutive (it never "jumps" as it's the case with <code>RANK</code>): rows with the same ranking column’s value are assigned the same rank, but the next rank value is one greater than the previously assigned rank.</p>
