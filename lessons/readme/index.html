<!-- Problem solving -->
<h3><span class="grey-text-span">How to use the course</span></h3>
<p>Here are five simple rules you should live by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read everything</li>
  <li>Run all the examples</li>
  <li>Do all the exercises</li>
  <li>Don't look at the solution too soon</li>
  <li>Type the code snippets by hand (don't copy-paste)</li>
</ol>

<p>Take these rules seriously. They probably come from an ancient Greek stoic, or something.</p>

<!-- Problem solving -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">Problem solving</span></h3>
<p>Youâ€™ve already seen those big hairy SQL statements with dozen of lines. Pretty scary right? Often, we get stuck before the apparent complexity of a difficult SQL problem. The truth is, most problems can be made easier with the right approach. The approach we will follow during this course is the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parse the problem statement</li>
  <li>Explore the dataset</li>
  <li>Break down the problem in smaller parts</li>
  <li>Solve these smaller problems one by bone</li>
</ol>

<!-- Best practices -->

<p>It's a good idea to have a consistent way of writing your SQL code. No need to reinvent the wheel, you can use this one: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sqlstyle.guide/">https://www.sqlstyle.guide/</a>.
