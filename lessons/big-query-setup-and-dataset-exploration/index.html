<!-- About BigQuery and Google Standard SQL -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">About BigQuery and Google Standard SQL</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>BigQuery is Googleâ€™s cloud data warehouse solution</li>
  <li>BigQuery is fast, scalable and cost-effective</li>
  <li>BigQuery supports the Google Standard SQL dialect which is an ANSI compliant flavor of SQL</li>
</ul>

<!-- Establishing the BigQuery environment -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">Setting up your BigQuery environment</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a Gmail account if donâ€™t have one</li>
  <li>Log into your Gmail account</li>
  <li>Go toÂ <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery">https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery</a></li>
  <li>If you donâ€™t already have a Google Cloud Project created, youâ€™ll be prompted to create one. ClickÂ Create ProjectÂ and follow the prompts.</li>
  <li>There are twoÂ versionsÂ of the Google BigQuery environment. The first is theÂ <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox">BigQuery sandbox</a>, a feature-limited, no-cost option for playing around with the tool.</li>
  <li>The other one is theÂ upgradedÂ environment, for which youâ€™ll need to provide your credit card.</li>
  <li>As instructors, weâ€™ll be using theÂ upgradedÂ environment, but start with the sandbox instead.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Monitoring BigQuery costs -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">Monitoring BigQuery costs</span></h3>
<p>If you grow out of the BigQuery sandbox, youâ€™ll need to create a billing account and keep an eye on your BigQuery usage in order to avoid surprise bills. To do so open this link: <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing">https://console.cloud.google.com/billing</a></p>
<p>When your billing account is created, click on your billing account from this same link to see your cost and cost projections. Bookmark that page and check it often. For this course though, you'll probably stay within the free tiers quota ðŸ˜‰.</p>
