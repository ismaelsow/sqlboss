<!-- About BigQuery and Google Standard SQL -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">About BigQuery and Google Standard SQL</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>BigQuery is a database built by Google, accessible in the cloud.</li>
  <li>It supports SQL queries, using Google Standard SQL dialect (a standard-compliant flavor of SQL).</li>
  <li>It's fast, scalable and cost-effective (offering a generous free plan).</li>
  <li>It's often used to build data warehouses in the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Establishing the BigQuery environment -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">Setting up your BigQuery environment</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a Gmail account if donâ€™t have one.</li>
  <li>Log into your Gmail account.</li>
  <li>Go toÂ <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery" target="_blank">https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery</a>.</li>
  <li>If you donâ€™t already have a Google Cloud Project created, youâ€™ll be prompted to create one. ClickÂ on the <i>Create Project</i> button,Â and follow the prompts.</li>
  <li>There are twoÂ versionsÂ of the Google BigQuery environment. The first is theÂ <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox" target="_blank">BigQuery sandbox</a>, a feature-limited, no-cost option for playing around with the tool.</li>
  <li>The other one is theÂ upgradedÂ environment, for which youâ€™ll need to provide your credit card.</li>
  <li>As instructors, weâ€™ll be using theÂ upgradedÂ environment, but you can start with the sandbox instead.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Monitoring BigQuery costs -->
<h3 class="h3-big-margin"><span class="grey-text-span">Monitoring BigQuery costs</span></h3>
<p>If you grow out of the BigQuery sandbox, youâ€™ll need to create a billing account and keep an eye on your BigQuery usage in order to avoid surprise bills. To do so open the following link: <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing" target="_blank">https://console.cloud.google.com/billing</a>.</p>
<p>Once your billing account is created, go to your your billing account (<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing" target="_blank">https://console.cloud.google.com/billing</a>) to see your costs and cost projections. Bookmark that page and check it often. For this course though, you'll probably stay within the free tiers quota ðŸ˜‰.</p>
